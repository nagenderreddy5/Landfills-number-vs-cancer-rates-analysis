# Are landfills causing a greater occurrence of cancers in their surrounding areas?

Over the past few decades, there has been an increasing public concern about the environmental consequences of landfills.  Groups such as Community Action Works, Just Moms STL, the Conservation Law Foundation and many others are working to draw attention to the pollution created by solid-waste landfills.  The groups’ focuses vary from individual health concerns to environmental concerns and climate change.  Regardless of end goal, one of the most common statistics used by these groups is the rate of chronic illnesses in areas surrounding landfills.  Just Moms STL is one of the most famous of these groups as they were the subject of an HBO documentary in 2017.  We decided to take this idea and expand it to all solid-waste landfill sites in the United States.

## Guiding Question:
Is there a correlation between landfill locations and increased incidence of cancer?

## Supplemental Questions:
Where are landfills located?
What is the incidence rate for one or cancers?

## Hypothesis:
Solid waste landfills are contributing to the incidence rate of cancer in the areas surrounding the landfill.

H0 (null) = There is no statistical difference in cancer rates in populations within counties that contain landfills versus the national cancer rate.
Ha (alternate)= There is a statistical difference in cancer rates in populations within counties that contain landfills versus the national cancer rate.

## Statistical findings
The National Cancer Institute says that the rate of new cases of cancer (cancer incidence) is 442.4 per 100,000 men and women per year (based on 2013–2017 cases).  The mean incidence rate for our data was 452 cases per 100,000, which is higher than the national average.  We compared this value to the average incidence per 100,000 for each county with landfill and cancer data.  The chi-squared test's statistic was significantly higher than the critical value, meaning that the results were statistically significant.  With this result, we have failed to reject our null hypothesis.
